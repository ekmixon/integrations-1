### DESCRIPTION

Use SignalFx to monitor Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services through StackDriver Monitoring. This integration enables data collection from all GCP web services that report to StackDriver.

### FEATURES

Connecting to GCP allows you to take advantage of SignalFxâ€™s extensive GCP support.

- SignalFx can sync metadata about your GCP hosts to enrich metrics reported by StackDriver or the [SignalFx collectd agent](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd)[](sfx_link:sfxcollectd).
- SignalFx provides built-in dashboards for many GCP services that report to StackDriver, such as [Google Compute Engine](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/google-compute-engine)[](sfx_link:google-compute-engine) and [Google Cloud Datastore](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/google-cloud-datastore)[](sfx_link:google-cloud-datastore).

### CONFIGURATION

Before you begin, you must be an administrator of your SignalFx account.

To connect SignalFx to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you must:

- Create a new GCP project service account key for SignalFx to use.
- Specify the services to monitor in SignalFx.
