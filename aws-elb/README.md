### INSTALLATION

To access this integration, [connect to CloudWatch](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/aws)[](sfx_link:aws).

By default SignalFx imports all CloudWatch metrics that are available in your account. To retrieve metrics for a subset of available services or regions, modify the connection on the Integrations page.

### USAGE

#### Uniquely identifying ELBs

SignalFx synthesizes a unique ID for each ELB in the dimension `AWSUniqueId`.

#### ELB metadata

For ELB, SignalFx will scan every load balancer name from your AWS account and pull out properties of the load balancer and any tags set on the load balancer.

| ELB Filter Name |	Custom Property |	Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| create-time | aws\_create\_time | The time stamp when the load balancer was created |

#### METRICS
